Project Euler Attempts
----------------------

These are my attempts at solving the Project Euler (http://www.projecteuler.net)
problems using Haskell. I’m doing this for fun, and releasing the code so that
a) I put a bit more effort in it, just because it is visible to anyone
b) more proficient Haskeller may give me tips on improving my code 
c) other people may take an inspiration for alternative solutions

That said, do not look at the code unless you have solved the corresponding
problem.  It is much more satisfactory to solve these on your own. Once you’ve
seen it, you can’t *un-see* it.

I’m always open to suggestions on coding style, more efficient implementations
and alternate techniques. Please note that I’m not playing code golf; I’m
*trying* to find the most elegant and comprehensible solution, not the
sparsest. Feel free to fork this, but don’t send me pull requests with
solutions to problems I haven’t solved yet.
